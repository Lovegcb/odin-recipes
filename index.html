                  There may be no more beloved Italian dish than carbonara: hot
                  pasta tossed with a creamy sauce of raw beaten eggs, accentuated
                  with crisp bits of guanciale, and finished with a shower of
                  grated aged Pecorino Romano cheese plus freshly ground black
                  pepper.

                  An Italian sauce that is usually combined with fettuccine noodles
                  and is referred to as fettuccine Alfredo. The sauce consists of
                  heavy cream or half and half that is mixed with butter, grated
                  Parmesan cheese, pepper, and occasionally nutmeg to create a rich
                  Italian meal.
